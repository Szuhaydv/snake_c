Game Logic:
    - We have an NxN array that keeps track of numbers representing:
        - A snake body cell with 1
        - A food with 2
        - Nothing with 0
    - We keep track of the head position, tail position (x,y coordinates) and direction in variables
    - We create a game loop that each N ms:
        - moves the snake head from current position to its direction
        - and updates head's position
        - deletes the value at tail position
        - and updates it based on the non-empty side next to it
    - Each time the snake eats a food, a new one spawns
    - The user can input arrow keys before tick and the last one specifies the diretion (or defaults if none pressed)

    Result of movements:
    - If the head moves out of bounds OR the snake moves into a cell with its own body - GAME OVER
    - If the snake eats a food it grows, meaning:
        - the tail doesn't get deleted
